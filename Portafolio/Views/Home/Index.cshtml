            I also have a strong interest and knowledge in blockchain and smart contracts, which I pursued through my Master's degree from USAL and several online courses. I have applied this domain expertise in some of my projects, such as creating a service that facilitates data transfer among different databases using Java and SQL. I am passionate about learning new skills and exploring new opportunities in the software engineering field.
